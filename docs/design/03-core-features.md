# Core Features - Atlas Integration Platform

## Overview
Atlas provides powerful features that enable users to break down information silos and gain insights across their entire digital workspace. Each feature is designed to solve specific user problems while working together as a cohesive system.

## 1. Universal Knowledge Search

### What It Does
Searches across all connected platforms (GitHub, Notion, Jira, Slack) from a single search box, understanding natural language queries and returning contextually relevant results.

### User Value
- **Save 70% time** vs searching each platform individually
- **Find hidden connections** between related information
- **Never miss important context** scattered across tools

### How Users Experience It
1. Type query in natural language: "authentication bug from last week"
2. See unified results from all platforms in seconds
3. Filter by source, type, or time if needed
4. Click through to original source or explore relationships

### Key Capabilities
- **Natural Language Understanding**: "Show me what John worked on last month"
- **Cross-Platform Intelligence**: Finds related items even without explicit links
- **Smart Ranking**: Prioritizes results based on relevance and recency
- **Preview Without Switching**: See content summary without leaving Atlas

### Example Searches
- "database migration issues"
- "everything about Project Apollo"
- "Sarah's recent documentation"
- "bugs fixed yesterday"
- "OAuth implementation"

## 2. Relationship Discovery

### What It Does
Automatically discovers and visualizes connections between issues, documents, code, and people across all platforms, revealing hidden dependencies and relationships.

### User Value
- **Understand impact** before making changes
- **Discover dependencies** not explicitly documented
- **See the full picture** of interconnected work

### How Users Experience It
1. View any item (issue, document, PR)
2. See "Related Items" section automatically populated
3. Understand why items are related (mentions, links, temporal, semantic)
4. Navigate relationship graph to explore further

### Relationship Types Discovered
- **Explicit Links**: Direct references between items
- **Mentions**: When one item mentions another
- **Temporal**: Items changed around the same time
- **Semantic**: Content similarity detected by AI
- **People**: Items involving same contributors

### Visual Representation
```

│   └── README.md (documents this)
├── May indirectly affect:
│   ├── user/dashboard.js (uses auth)
│   ├── api/routes.js (depends on auth)
│   └── mobile/app.js (calls auth API)
└── Should notify:
    ├── Alex (owns auth module)
    ├── Sarah (PM for auth feature)
    └── Mobile team (consumers)
