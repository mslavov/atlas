# User Personas - Atlas Integration Platform

## Overview
Atlas is designed primarily for AI agents who need to understand, modify, test, and maintain codebases. The platform is managed by a human System Administrator who configures and maintains the integration platform. These personas represent the primary user types, with AI agents as the end users consuming the unified knowledge.
